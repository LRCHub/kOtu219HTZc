The summers has come to pass
I gotta get my mind out of you
I care too much so
I gotta go, I'm not sure
I can take this now
The jealous and fear of you
Leaving because that is life
And there's nothing I can do but run.

Cause you mean everything to me.
The times I don't want to get trapped in my own head
When I don't want to get out of bed
I'd rather feel alone then leave with this pain
I really have to go.
Cause you mean everything to me.

I rip my feelings from my heart,
I don't want you there,
I'll never give my love again,
Cause everytime that I feel my heart crashing down
I pick up and dust myself off.
Cause you mean everything to me.
