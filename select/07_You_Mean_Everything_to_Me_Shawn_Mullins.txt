I've been on the road too long
And Ive been stuck inside a song
And you know our love has been
Through rougher weather
But our passion's like a rose
The season's tell it how it grows
And not much compares
To the times we've shared together
Cause love heals everything
We're no exception to the rule
You mean everything to me
So if there is anything at all
All youve got to do is call
And you know that I would
Drive 10, 000 miles
Just to show you that I care
Just to kiss your honey hair
And pull you close and hold you
Like a child

Love heals everything
We're no exception to that rule
You mean everything
You mean everything
You mean everything to me
