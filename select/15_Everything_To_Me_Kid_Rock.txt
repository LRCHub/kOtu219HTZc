I'm tired and ain't been sleeping
And right now I'm barely breathing
Reaching for you but you're not there
I miss your conversation
The way you taste, your smiling face and
These pictures hurt when I sit and stare

And oh, you're so beautiful to me
And I have been so blind, I couldn't see

I've been lying to you, baby
I've been dying inside lately
Lord knows I been lying to myself
So selfish, I could kill me
So empty, I feel filthy
I took your love and placed it on a shelf

Well, oh, you're so beautiful
And I can't help myself

You been the voice of reason
I've been up late night preaching
You took the fall each time I fell
But still you stayed and loved me
And right now with God up above me
I swear he saved me from myself

And oh, you're so beautiful And deep
And I've been chasing things that I don't need

I've been lying to you, baby
I've been dying inside lately
Lord knows I been lying to myself
So selfish, I could kill me
So helpless, I feel filthy
I took the first step but Lord knows I need twelve

And oh, you're so beautiful
And I can't help myself

And I know I'm no stranger to the rain
So don't be trying to wash away the pain
Wash away the pain

I've been lying to you, baby
Half high and crying crazy
And Lord knows I've been lying to myself
So selfish, I could kill me
So empty, I feel filthy
I tried it my way but this time I need help

And I pray, someday, love will set us free
And even if this wasn't meant to be
Please know you are everything
You're everything to me
