You're my everything
My life and town
You're the stars in my eyes
The passive sounds
You're those loving fantasies
With reality
You're that perfect ten
Numbered so womanly
You're the colored balloons
In the big parade
All the happy thoughts
Ooh in my mind today

You mean everything to me
I know just what I wanna do
I wanna give me up to you, to you
You were my dream come true
When first meeting you
The laughter, the fun
Flattering things we do
Embraced in arms
I just feel so free, so free
Pardon me, pardon me, pardon me
Say you belong to me
Do you need a friend?
If you need a friend
Someone to go walking
Holding hands again
Whatcha say?

You mean everything to me
I know just what I wanna do
I wanna give me up to you, to you
Ooh
Ooh
Alright
Shee be doo
Shee be doo
Shee be doo
Sure is cool

You're my everything
My life and town
You're the stars in my eyes
The passive sounds
Those loving fantasies with reality
You're that perfect ten
Numbered so womanly

You mean everything to me
So cool, so cool
So sweet to you
You mean everything to me
I wanna give me up to you
Sure being smooth
You mean everything to me
I know just what I wanna do
I wanna give me up to you, to you
Ooh
Love me true
It's alright, it's alright
Ooh

You're the colored balloons
In the big parade
All the happy thoughts, you in my mind today
You mean everything to me
I know just what I wanna do
I wanna give all my loving to you
Baby
You mean everything to me
I wanna count from one to three
You better bring it on again
