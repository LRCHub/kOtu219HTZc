Your love, your love
Means everything to me
Your love, your love
Means everything
Everything to me

When I was down and out
You took me in
I remember that rainy day
When you looked up
And you said
Baby, I love you
Yes, you did

Your love, your love
Means everything to me
Your love means
Everything to me
Your sweet love, girl
Means everything to me

My mama told me
There will come a day
When the right girl would
Surely come my way

She said, son, son
Listen to me
I want you to hear
Everything I say

You might be running around
With Sue and Jane, everybody
But let me tell you something

One of these days, son
One of these good old days
Some good day, somebody
Gonna walk up to you
Won't have to say a thing

Someday, somebody
Gonna tip up on you
Won't have to say
A doggone thing

Yeah, she said listen
You're gonna feel it, son
She said, you're gonna feel it
