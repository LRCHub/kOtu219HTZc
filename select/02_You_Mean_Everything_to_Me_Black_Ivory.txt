You mean everything, to me and I just can't let you go this way
(For something I don't need to say)
You mean everything, to me and I just can't let it end this way
(The tears I cry are too much to pay oh yeah)
I love the way you love to love me girl
You've got eyes and you can see that, I've been acting carelessly. (Ohhhh)
I just don't want to be a lonely guy
You would make me sad if you would go away
You mean everything, to me and I just can't let you go this way
(Not for something I forgot to say oh yes.)
You mean everything, to me and I just can't let it end this way

You mean everything to me and I just can't let you go this way
