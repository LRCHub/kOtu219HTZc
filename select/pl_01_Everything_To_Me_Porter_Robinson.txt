Two, two, three, four
Strobe lights, heart signs
Then it's over, it's over
But half my long life
You were with me,
it went quickly
It's you
And me
And the air in between
Mm-mm
All of me
And all of you
Nothing else in the room.
Saw me fondly
You don't know me,
but you know me
I guard my soft mind
'Cause I have to, didn't want to
And it's you
And me
And the air in between
Mm-mm
All of me
And all of you
Nothing else in the room
(This seems like
it's everything to me)
If this is goodbye,
if I won't see you again
Waiting on a corner
with your phone in hand
If irony is a virtue,
maybe I should be king
Crush me like a plushie,
I'll be one of your things
And maybe I'm addicted
to the look in your eyes
It's hard to say
you've had enough
when you get this high
I shouldn't say I love you,
I don't know your name
But I just say it anyway
'cause it feels the same
when it's you
And me
And the air in between
Mm-mm
All of me and all of you
Nothing else in the room
(This seems like
it's everything to me)
